MONAI is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based, [open-source](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/master/LICENSE) platform for deep learning in healthcare imaging. Its ambitions are:
- developing a community of academic, industrial and clinical researchers collaborating on a common foundation;
- creating state-of-the-art, end-to-end training workflows for healthcare imaging;
- providing researchers with the optimized and standardized way to create and evaluate deep learning models.


## Features
> _The codebase is currently under active development._

- flexible pre-processing for multi-dimensional medical imaging data;
- compositional & portable APIs for ease of integration in existing workflows;
- domain-specific implementations for networks, losses, evaluation metrics and more;
- customizable design for varying user expertise;
- multi-GPU data parallelism support.
