# Project MONAI
**M**edical **O**pen **N**etwork for **AI** - _Toolkit for Healthcare Imaging_

_Contact: <monai.miccai2019@gmail.com>_

This document identifies key concepts of project MONAI at a high level, the goal is to facilitate further technical discussions of requirements,roadmap, feasibility and trade-offs.

## Vision
   *   Develop a community of academic, industrial and clinical researchers collaborating and working on a common foundation of standardized tools.
   *   Create a state-of-the-art, end-to-end training toolkit for healthcare imaging.
   *   Provide academic and industrial researchers with the optimized and standardized way to create and evaluate models

## Targeted users
   *   Primarily focused on the healthcare researchers who develop DL models for medical imaging

## Goals
   *   Deliver domain-specific workflow capabilities
   *   Address the end-end “Pain points” when creating medical imaging deep learning workflows.
   *   Provide a robust foundation with a performance optimized system software stack that allows researchers to focus on the research and not worry about software development principles.

## Guiding principles
### Modularity
   *   Pythonic -- object oriented components
   *   Compositional -- can combine components to create workflows
   *   Extensible -- easy to create new components and extend existing components
   *   Easy to debug -- loosely coupled, easy to follow code (e.g. in eager or graph mode)
   *   Flexible -- interfaces for easy integration of external modules
### User friendly
   *   Portable -- use components/workflows via Python “import”
   *   Run well-known baseline workflows in a few commands
   *   Access to the well-known public datasets in a few lines of code
### Standardisation
   *   Unified/consistent component APIs with documentation specifications
   *   Unified/consistent data and model formats, compatible with other existing standards
### High quality
   *   Consistent coding style - extensive documentation - tutorials - contributors’ guidelines
   *   Reproducibility -- e.g. system-specific deterministic training
### Future proof
   *   Task scalability -- both in datasets and computational resources
   *   Support for advanced data structures -- e.g. graphs/structured text documents
### Leverage existing high-quality software packages whenever possible
   *   E.g. low-level medical image format reader, image preprocessing with external packages
   *   Rigorous risk analysis of choice of foundational software dependencies
### Compatible with external software
   *   E.g. data visualisation, experiments tracking, management, orchestration
